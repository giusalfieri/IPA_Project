## Introduction

The aim of this project is to develop an automated system for detecting aircraft in satellite imagery. The project utilizes a combination of image processing techniques, feature extraction methods, and machine learning algorithms to achieve high accuracy in aircraft detection.

## Features

- **Training Phase:** Extract data from CSV for SVM training.
- **Template Extraction:** Extract templates from the dataset.
- **Clustering:** Perform K-Means clustering based on size and intensity.
- **Image Resizing:** Resize images within each cluster to uniform dimensions.
- **Eigenplanes Generation:** Generate eigenplanes for the clustered images.
- **Classification:** Classify images using SVM and HOG features.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of the classifier.


## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/giusalfieri/IPA_Project.git
    cd aircraft-detection-satellite-images
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    Ensure you have OpenCV, CMake, and other necessary libraries installed. You can install the required Python packages using:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Build the project:**
    ```sh
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    ```

2. **Run the project:**
    ```sh
    ./aircraft_detection [step1] [step2] ...
    ```
    For example, to run the training phase and extract templates:
    ```sh
    ./aircraft_detection training_phase extractTemplates
    ```

## Workflow Steps ‚û°Ô∏è‚û°Ô∏è‚û°Ô∏è

### 1. Training Phase
Initiate the training phase for an SVM model by extracting data from a CSV file.
```sh
./aircraft_detection training_phase
```
