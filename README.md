<summary>***CMake GUI and Visual Studio Instructions***</summary>
  
1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/giusalfieri/IPA_Project.git
    cd IPA_Project
    ```

2. **Open CMake GUI:**
    - Set the "Where is the source code" field to the path of the `IPA_Project` directory.
    - Set the "Where to build the binaries" field to a new `build` directory within the `IPA_Project` directory (e.g., `IPA_Project/build`).

3. **Configure the project:**
    - Click on the "Configure" button.
    - Select your version of Visual Studio (e.g., Visual Studio 2019) and the appropriate platform (e.g., x64).
    - Click "Finish" to start the configuration process.
    - If there are any missing dependencies, resolve them and click "Configure" again.

4. **Generate the project files:**
    - Once the configuration is complete, click the "Generate" button to create the Visual Studio solution and project files.

5. **Open the project in Visual Studio:**
    - Navigate to the `build` directory and open the generated `.sln` file (e.g., `IPA_Project.sln`) with Visual Studio.

6. **Build the project:**
    - In Visual Studio, set the build configuration to `Release` or `Debug` as needed.
    - Build the solution by selecting "Build Solution" from the "Build" menu.

7. **Run the project:**

For example, to run the entire pipeline, you can set the command-line arguments in the project properties as:

```sh
./aircraft_detection_project training_phase extractTemplates KMeansBySize KMeansByIntensity resizeImagesInClusters generateEigenplanes extract_SVM_Training_Data Performance_evaluation
```

Or you can run individual steps as needed. See the [Pipeline](#pipeline) section for detailed steps.

## <a name="pipeline">‚û°Ô∏è ‚úÖ ‚û°Ô∏è ‚úÖ Pipeline</a>
> [!NOTE]
> In the following lines, workflow steps instructions are given and explained.
> After each phase is concluded, meaning that each command given has terminated execution, a corresponding file with a .done extension is created in /src/steps_completed folder.
> While given a command, the program checks if the previous step has been done, checking the existance of the corresponding file in /src/steps_completed folder; if not, a warning message indicating the missing step is printed out.

### 1. Training Phase
Initiate the training phase for an SVM model by extracting data from a CSV file.
The extracted data is prepared and formatted to be used for training the SVM algorithm.
```sh
./aircraft_detection_project training_phase
```
---
### 2. Template extraction Phase
Extract templates from the dataset, which are necessary for further processing and analysis.
This can be done by executing the command:
```sh
./aircraft_detection_project extractTemplates
```
---
### 3. K-means-by-size clustering Phase
Apply the K-Means clustering algorithm to group extracted templates, treated as data points, based on their size; templates with similar dimensions are grouped into clusters.
Do this by executing the following command:
```sh
./aircraft_detection_project KMeansBySize
```
---
### 4. K-means-by-intensity clustering Phase
Apply the K-Means clustering algorithm to group extracted templates, treated as data points, based on their intensity; templates with similar intensity values are grouped into clusters.
This can be done by executing:
```sh
./aircraft_detection_project KMeansByIntensity
```
---
### 5. Images resizing Phase 
All the images in each cluster need to have the same dimensions as this is necessary for generating eigenplanes (see next phase).
In order to do this, execute as follows: 
```sh
./aircraft_detection_project resizeImagesInClusters
```
---
### 6. Eigenplanes generating Phase 
Generate Eigenplanes for each cluster of images previously resized.
By "Eigenplanes" is meant the outcome of the application of the EigenFace algorithm.
The details of the algorithm can be read here: https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/da/d60/tutorial_face_main.html
Execute the following command:
```sh
./aircraft_detection_project generateEigenplanes
```
---
### 7. Detection Phase 
This is the most important step.
Classify the given testing image based on the features extracted in the previous phase (HOG features).
This phase consists in performing template matching, classifying points by YOLO boxes, extracting ROIs and finally using a SVM model to classify the ROIs.
In SVM training, 10 fold cross validation is done, and the outcome are two .sco files, relative to true positives and negatives, respectively; these two files must then be placed in /src/svm_cv_outputs directory.
Every row in these files is a sample (candidate region) with a classification score associated, columns being sample id and score. 
Detection is done by executing:
```shs
./aircraft_detection_project extract_SVM_Training_Data
```
---
### 8. Performance evaluation phase 
Evaluate the performance of detection done in the previous step by running a Python script, to obtain the Precision-Recall curve and the average precision, calculated with trapezoidal method.
```sh
./aircraft_detection_project Performance_evaluation
```
