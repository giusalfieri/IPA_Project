## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- **Training Phase:** Extract data from CSV for SVM training.
- **Template Extraction:** Extract templates from the dataset.
- **Clustering:** Perform K-Means clustering based on size and intensity.
- **Image Resizing:** Resize images within each cluster to uniform dimensions.
- **Eigenplanes Generation:** Generate eigenplanes for the clustered images.
- **Classification:** Classify images using SVM and HOG features.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of the classifier.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation 

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/giusalfieri/IPA_Project.git
    cd aircraft-detection-satellite-images
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    Ensure you have OpenCV, CMake, and other necessary libraries installed. You can install the required Python packages using:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Build the project:**
    ```sh
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    ```

2. **Run the project:**
    ```sh
    ./aircraft_detection_project [step1] [step2] ...
    ```
    For example, to run the training phase and extract templates:
    ```sh
    ./aircraft_detection_project training_phase extractTemplates
    ```
