## Introduction

The aim of this project is to develop an automated system for detecting aircraft in satellite imagery. The project utilizes a combination of image processing techniques, feature extraction methods, and machine learning algorithms to achieve high accuracy in aircraft detection.

---

## <a name="features">‚öôÔ∏è Features</a>

- **Straight airplanes Extraction:** Extract straightened airplanes from the training dataset images.
- **Clustering:** Perform K-Means clustering based on size and intensity on the airplanes previously extracted.
- **Image Resizing:** Resize images within each cluster to uniform dimensions.
- **Eigenplanes Generation:** Generate eigenplanes for the clustered images.
- **SVM Training Data Extraction:** Extract data from CSV for SVM training..
- **Performance Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of the classifier.

> [!NOTE]  
> The training dataset used is a sub-set of the training dataset of [HRPlanesv2 Data Set](https://github.com/dilsadunsal/HRPlanesv2-Data-Set).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> For a detailed description of the underlying ***ratio*** of design choices taken, see [project_report.pdf](docs/paper_project.pdf).

</details>


<details>
<summary><strong>CMake GUI and Visual Studio Instructions</strong></summary>
  
1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/giusalfieri/IPA_Project.git
    cd IPA_Project
    ```

2. **Open CMake GUI:**
    - Set the "Where is the source code" field to the path of the `IPA_Project` directory.
    - Set the "Where to build the binaries" field to a new `build` directory within the `IPA_Project` directory (e.g., `IPA_Project/build`).

3. **Configure the project:**
    - Click on the "Configure" button.
    - Select your version of Visual Studio (e.g., Visual Studio 2019) and the appropriate platform (e.g., x64).
    - Click "Finish" to start the configuration process.
    - If there are any missing dependencies, resolve them and click "Configure" again.

4. **Generate the project files:**
    - Once the configuration is complete, click the "Generate" button to create the Visual Studio solution and project files.

5. **Open the project in Visual Studio:**
    - Navigate to the `build` directory and open the generated `.sln` file (e.g., `IPA_Project.sln`) with Visual Studio.

6. **Build the project:**
    - In Visual Studio, set the build configuration to `Release` or `Debug` as needed.
    - Build the solution by selecting "Build Solution" from the "Build" menu.

7. **Run the project:**
    - In Visual Studio, set the startup project to `aircraft_detection_project`.
    - Configure the project properties if needed to include any command-line arguments.
    - Start debugging or run the project without debugging as needed.

## <a name="usage">üöÄ Usage</a>

To run the *entire* pipeline, use the following command in the directory where the executable is located:

```sh
./aircraft_detection_project extractStraightAirplanes KMeansBySize KMeansByIntensity resizeImagesInClusters generateEigenplanes extract_SVM_Training_Data Performance_evaluation
```

Or you can run individual steps as needed. See the [Pipeline](#pipeline) section for the *exact order* in which the steps should be executed.

> [!NOTE]
> It is **strongly suggested** to execute the steps **one by one**, as some of them are computationally intensive. For example, `extract_SVM_Training_Data` involves *template matching* for numerous images, each with many airplane templates.


---

## <a name="pipeline">‚û°Ô∏è ‚úÖ ‚û°Ô∏è Pipeline</a>


The steps in the pipeline must be executed in the following order to ensure the correct functioning of the process:

1. `extractStraightAirplanes`
2. `KMeansBySize`
3. `KMeansByIntensity`
4. `resizeImagesInClusters`
5. `generateEigenplanes`
6. `extract_SVM_Training_Data`
7. `Performance_evaluation`

Make sure to follow this precise order when running the steps.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After each phase completes, a `.done` file is created in the `/src/steps_completed folder`. When a command is issued, the program verifies the previous step's completion by checking for the corresponding `.done` file. If the file is missing, a warning message indicates the unmet prerequisite.

> [!NOTE]
> The step `extractStraightAirplanes` has already been completed by us, and its `.done` file is already present inside `/src/steps_completed` folder. 
> Furthermore, the straight airplanes extracted by us, must be downloaded from a Google Drive folder: see this [README.md](./src/straight_airplanes/README.md). 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please ensure that the folders `/src/dataset_training`and `/src/dataset_for_straight_airplanes_extraction` are populated as specified in their respective README files: [dataset_training README](./src/dataset_training/README.md) and [dataset_for_straight_airplanes_extraction README](./src/dataset_for_straight_airplanes_extraction/README.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The output of the SVM in cross-validation mode are two `.sco` files. Rename them  `positive.sco` and `negative.sco` and put them inside `/src/svm_cv_outputs` directory.

A detailed description of each step can be found by invoking the executable with the `--help` option:
